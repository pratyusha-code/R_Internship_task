## Problem Statement
In bike-sharing systems, the entire process from membership to rental and return
has been automated. Using these systems, users can easily rent a bike from one
location and return it to another. Hence, a bike rental company wants to
understand and predict the number of bikes rented daily based on the
environment and seasons.
